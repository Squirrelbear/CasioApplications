This collection of applications were designed and developed on a Casio Graphics Calculator around 2006 to 2008. Many are games, and some are applications I wrote to assist with teaching other students maths. The G1M files contain the files suitable for an fx9860 Casio Calculator. These can be loaded up via more recent Casio software such as the "Program Link Software(FA-124)" on https://edu.casio.com/forteachers/er/software/.
